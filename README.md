Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this activity was to take a set of data from the entertainment
industry on how many successes, fails, and canceled events based on the funding
of each project. After analyzing the data I was able to create charts based on
the customers needs.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Overview of the Analysis

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One of the major challenges of this activity was the lack of tutorials about excel for Mac. Once I was able to learn how to navigate excel the activity went very smoothly.
